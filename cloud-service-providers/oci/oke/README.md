# NIM on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) OKE

To deploy NIM on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) successfully, itâ€™s crucial to choose the correct GPU shapes and ensure that the appropriate NVIDIA drivers are installed. 

When you select a GPU shape for a managed node pool or self-managed node in OKE, you must also select a compatible Oracle Linux GPU image that has the CUDA libraries pre-installed. The names of compatible images include 'GPU'. OCI offers Oracle Linux (OEL) providing the possibility to use pre-installed GPU drivers. This simplifies the deployment process for NIM.
